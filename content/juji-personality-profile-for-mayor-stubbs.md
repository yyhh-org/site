What makes Mayor Stubbs special?

Check out the [personality (or shall I say, catality) profile for Mayor Stubbs](https://juji.io/me/mayorstubbs/basic) constructed by [Juji](http://juji.io) based on Mayor Stubbs' tweets.

Have you meet Mayor Stubbs? Does this sound like him?

What really makes me smile is the summary of the profile. Mayor Stubbs is "curious investigator". This is amazingly accurate: is there a cat that is not curious? I don't think so.

Does your pet have its own twitter or Facebook account? If so, check out its [Juji profile](http://juji.io) or check out your own or your friends'. It's super fun.
