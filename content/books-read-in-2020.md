I challenge myself to read or listen to 52 books in 2020. I'm listing them here with a short descriptions about them to keep track of what I've read and key ideas learned.

1\. [The Minimalist Home: A Room-by-Room Guide to a Decluttered, Refocused Life](https://amzn.to/2QARQhS) As a minimalist at heart, this is a great book for me to read (or rather to listen to). It provides inspiring stories as well as practical tips. By minimizing our life (it means different things to different people), we can focus on the things that are actually important to us.

2. [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://amzn.to/39ZVb30) This book talks about Motivation 3.0 and discusses the three critical elements of Motivation 3.0: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. As a computer scientist in a world-class research lab, I completely agree with the importance of intrinsic motivation for highly creative work for myself and those I work with. It is really important for organizations and individuals to understand how to provide such an environment at work and at home. The author also provides good reference materials [online](https://www.danpink.com/resources/) worthwhile to check out. 

3. [The Gifts of Imperfection](https://www.amazon.com/Gifts-Imperfection-Think-Supposed-Embrace/dp/159285849X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31T7OSB97QTJ4&dchild=1&keywords=the+gift+of+imperfection&qid=1603980797&sprefix=the+gift+of+imp%2Caps%2C210&sr=8-1) This took talks about how to lead a wholehearted and lives a meaningful life based on who you are, not you are supposed to be.
