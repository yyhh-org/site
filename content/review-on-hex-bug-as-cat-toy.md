I am consistantly looking for new ways to entertain the cats, as they get bored with their toys very quickly. One new toy I have recently bought for them is [Hex Ant](https://www.amazon.com/HEXBUG-Fire-Ant-Colors-vary/dp/B00TV0S746).

I tried it during the cats outdoor time.  Mayori completely ingored it, while Tom was obviously attracted to it immediately.

He tried to smell it.

Unfortunately, his interest towards the new toy didn't last long. He quickly walked away as soon as he found out it is not a real bug.

I thus don't recommend it for cat toy. However, it is an interesting piece of toy for myself. So I still recommend it as a human toy.
