Year 2008 is less than 12 hours away for me. In fact, it is already 2008 in most part of the world. For many people, it is time to make their new year resolution. It is true for me as well.

Before I make a new one for 2008, though. Let me first review the one I have made for 2007 --- learning practical Spanish. How well I do with this one? Well, one thing I can tell you is that I have just returned from a trip to Mexico and could barely bargain price in Spanish. The good news is, though, I do learn a little and will continue learning Spanish. So my 2007 resolution should not count as a total failure. :-P

So what is my new year resolution for year 2008? Nothing special, actually. My focus on year 2008 is to live a healthy and happy life, which means many small things such as regular physical exercises, healthy diet, good balance of work and life, etc. These things are hard to measure but extremely import for all human being. I hope a year later, before I make another new year resolution, I could proudly pronounce that I have reached my goal in 2008.
