If you have one or more long hair cats at home, like our Mayori and Tom, you probably share the same dream as us --- a house without cat hair, at least a house without having cat hair everywhere.

Towards this dream, we have tried out various products. Here is a list of the various vacuums we have used.

  
1\. [Hoover WindTunnel T-Series Rewind Upright Vacuum](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HFDLCK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002HFDLCK&linkCode=as2&tag=yunyaoshome-20)

It work pretty well on carpet, but it is not good for hard surface like hardwood floor --- the air blowing out of it makes the cat hair flying everywhere. It's bagless, so cleaning it is not a very pleasant task. Fortunately, Huahai is usually the one doing the cleaning work. ðŸ˜›

Overall, this is a cheap and durable vacuum. Ours lasted for over 4 years with at least weekly usage. I would recommend getting it if you live in an all-carpet place or plan to use it in combination of another vacuum for hardwood/tile floor.

2\. [Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HUYGM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006HUYGM&linkCode=as2&tag=yunyaoshome-20)

As indicated by many online reviews, this is a surprisingly powerful vacuum given it's size. I brought it to do some quick cleaning job. However, I don't really like it that much --- it's not cordless, so using it for quick cleaning is not particularly convenient. It is too heavy and too noisy for me to do any thorough cleaning job.Â  We have already got rid of it after having it sitting in our garage for over a year.

3\. [Electrolux Ergorapido Bagless Cordless Handheld/Stick Vacuum Cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IAY3N0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002IAY3N0&linkCode=as2&tag=yunyaoshome-20)

[<img src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002IAY3N0&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;WS=1&amp;tag=yunyaoshome-20" class="xygptcvqdiihxtebyxzn" />](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IAY3N0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002IAY3N0&linkCode=as2&tag=yunyaoshome-20)

I like this vacuum a lot --- it is lightweighted and dual-usage. This is the one we have been using for nearly 5 years for quick cleaning job. (BTW, if you are Costco member, you can get it for lower price from Costoc than from Amazon.com, especially when it is on sale with coupon).

4\. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TW208M/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B002TW208M&amp;link_code=as3&amp;tag=yunyaoshome-20" id="static_txt_preview">Miele Olympus S2120 Canister Vacuum Cleaner</a>

This one is expensive but works like a dream, especially for cat hair as the air is blowing from the top. It is very powerful yet very quite. Great for both hardwood floor and carpet (with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVHY10/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B000HVHY10&amp;link_code=as3&amp;tag=yunyaoshome-20" id="static_txt_preview">Miele Floor Brush</a>). This will be the vacuum that we are going to use for many year to come.

Even with Miele, we still need additional help --- Roomba is the perfect solution for busy people like us. If you had an old Roomba before and found cleaning it a pain, please take another look at it --- the cleaning tools coming with the newer generations of Roomba makes the cleaning much easier than before. This one is also a keeper.
