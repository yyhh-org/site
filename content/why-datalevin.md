I used to work at the place where SQL is invented (IBM Research at Almaden, San Jose, CA), so I know some of the people who invented the thing. To them, it was a toy, they did not anticipate its rise, to say the least, i.e. they don’t like it. There are too many problems with it:  it’s not composible, it’s not compact, it’s inconsistent, it does not integrate well with programming languages, it is not declarative enough, so on and so forth…

People who invented the thing don’t like it, guess that tells you something. In reality, when people have alternative, e.g. as I said in the beginning of the Datalevin README, my observation is that whoever used Datomic flavor of Datalog prefers it over any flavor of SQL, that’s my motivation to start the project.

SQL is a pretty bad interface, that’s the reason for me to develop something else. SQL is the product of the misguided nature-language like programming language fade at that time. My PhD is in human computer interaction, so I know the history well. It just doesn’t work from a HCI point of view. It ends up making things more complicated than necessary. The whole cottage industry of sql tooling is the proof.  I want to make things simple.
