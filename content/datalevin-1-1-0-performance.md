Summary: Datalevin 1.1.0 combines fast durable transactions with leading results on relational, graph, document, and logical workloads. Six charts show the measurements, their scope, and the remaining gaps.
---

When we released [Datalevin 1.0.0](/blog/2026/07/datalevin-100-is-here-one-database-for-application-state-and-agent-memory/),
the message was that one database could handle application state across
relational, graph, document, and logical workloads. With
[Datalevin 1.1.0](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/releases/tag/1.1.0),
we can make a stronger case: that breadth comes with state-of-the-art
performance on demanding benchmarks.

The results cover durable transactions, complex relational joins, social graph
queries, nested documents, and recursive rules. Datalevin competes with SQLite,
PostgreSQL, Neo4j, MongoDB, and dedicated logic engines, using the same database
and Datalog query interface.

Here are the headline observations from the benchmark artifacts in the
[Datalevin repository](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks):

| Workload | Datalevin result | Comparison in the measured configuration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Durable transactions | 114,739 records/s, synchronous strict WAL, batches of 1,000 | **3.57×** SQLite's throughput |
| Relational queries | All 113 JOB queries in 38.073 seconds | **3.37×** as fast as PostgreSQL by total query time |
| Graph queries | Lower latency on 20 of 21 LDBC-derived read queries | **8.56×** as fast as Neo4j by summed time; **5.55×** by geometric mean |
| Document reads | 11,454 operations/s, one worker, workload C with document queries | **3.99×** MongoDB, the next fastest system |
| Logical queries | Lowest latency on all ten selected OpenRuleBench-derived tasks | **1.07×–18.11×** as fast as the fastest alternative for each task |

Each comparison applies to the configuration and workload measured. Together,
they make the case for Datalevin as a serious performance choice
across data models. The details also show where other systems remain ahead.

## Durable transactions

A useful database has to accept changes quickly while maintaining its indexes
and honoring its commit promises.

The [write benchmark](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks/write-bench)
inserts one million person records. Each contains a UUID string identity, first
name, last name, and age. SQLite maintains its primary-key index and three
explicit value indexes; Datalevin maintains its entity-attribute-value and
attribute-value-entity indexes automatically. The comparison aligns logical
records and API transaction boundaries, although the physical index work differs.

The chart uses Datalevin's **strict WAL** profile and SQLite's **WAL with
`synchronous=FULL`**. Both use their ordinary OS sync behavior; the benchmark's
separate macOS `fullfsync` condition is outside this chart. Data generation,
transaction processing, and commit completion contribute to throughput.

![Strict WAL throughput for batches of 1, 10, 100, and 1,000 records. Datalevin synchronous: 8,186, 26,519, 44,747, 114,739 records/s. SQLite: 8,822, 17,609, 22,840, 32,105. Datalevin asynchronous: 102,133, 195,976, 245,485, 238,974.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/transactions.svg)

For synchronous writes, SQLite is slightly faster at one record per
transaction. Datalevin pulls ahead as batches grow: **1.51×** at ten records,
**1.96×** at 100, and **3.57×** at 1,000.

The asynchronous API adds another useful capability. It combines queued
requests into physical transactions, reaching **245,485 records per second**
at a request batch size of 100 while retaining strict WAL acknowledgment.
This is a different submission pattern from the blocking APIs: multiple
requests remain outstanding, so request throughput should not be read as the
number of physical commits or as single-request latency.

Concurrent callers also benefit. With four synchronous callers and
1,000-record batches, Datalevin reaches **151,622 records/s**, compared with
SQLite's **50,735**, a **2.99×** throughput advantage. In the mixed workload,
each iteration looks up a person and upserts a complete record. The blocking
strict-WAL paths deliver **5,616 pairs/s** for Datalevin and **5,041** for SQLite.
Datalevin's asynchronous path reaches **16,996 pairs/s**, with reads using the
latest available snapshot and no read-your-write barrier between outstanding
requests. These results come from the retained
[concurrent](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/write-bench/results/2026-08-31-strict-wal-concurrent.edn)
and [mixed](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/write-bench/results/2026-08-31-strict-wal-mixed.edn)
artifacts.

The practical result is that Datalevin offers both a competitive blocking
transaction path and substantial throughput when an application can batch or
pipeline its work.

## Relational queries: complex joins in 38 seconds

The [Join Order Benchmark](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks/JOB-bench)
asks a harder question than point-lookup benchmarks do: can an optimizer choose
good plans for complex joins over real, correlated data?

JOB contains 113 queries over an IMDB dataset comprising 21 tables. In
Datalevin, the data becomes **277,878,411 datoms**. Each engine executes a
complete warmup pass followed by a complete measurement pass. PostgreSQL and
Datalevin report planning and execution time inside the database, excluding
client startup and communication overhead.

![Total JOB query time: Datalevin 38.1 seconds, PostgreSQL 128.2 seconds, SQLite at least 821.8 seconds including nine 60-second timeouts.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/relational.svg)

Datalevin completes the suite in **38.073 seconds**, versus **128.231 seconds**
for PostgreSQL. SQLite spends **281.849 seconds** on the 104 queries it
finishes, and nine more queries hit the 60-second cutoff. Charging only that
cutoff for each timeout gives SQLite a lower bound of **821.849 seconds**, or
**21.59×** Datalevin's total. The hatched part of its bar makes those timeouts
visible.

Datalevin's advantage comes from the suite as a whole: it is faster than
PostgreSQL on **65 of 113 queries**. PostgreSQL wins the other 48, including
some queries where Datalevin's planning overhead is substantial. Datalevin
spends 6.689 seconds planning, about **17.6%** of its total. There is still
room to make planning cheaper while preserving the execution savings.

For applications with complex relationships, the result challenges the idea
that moving away from a relational storage model requires giving up relational
query performance.

## Graph queries: a general database takes on Neo4j

The [graph harness](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks/LDBC-SNB-bench)
implements all 14 Interactive Complex reads and seven Interactive Short reads
from LDBC Social Network Benchmark Interactive v1. The SF1 dataset represents
a social network; the Neo4j import contains approximately 3.65 million nodes
and 20.63 million relationships.

Both engines run embedded, eliminating network transport from this comparison.
Each gets a complete warmup pass, followed by a measurement pass in a fresh
JVM. Filesystem pages can remain warm, while query parsing and planning are
included in the measured call. Final-result caching is disabled.

![Neo4j-to-Datalevin latency ratios for all 21 graph queries on a logarithmic scale. Datalevin leads on 20 queries; Neo4j leads narrowly on IC10. Summed-time ratio is 8.56 and geometric mean is 5.55.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/graph.svg)

In the [September 1 comparison](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/LDBC-SNB-bench/results/comparison-20260901T235851Z.edn),
Datalevin takes **4.480 seconds** across all 21 reads, versus **38.346 seconds**
for Neo4j Community Embedded 2026.06.0. Datalevin wins 20 queries; Neo4j is
about 5% faster on IC10.

The **8.56×** summed-time advantage is influenced heavily by IC14. Giving each
query equal weight through the geometric mean of its latency ratio still
favors Datalevin by **5.55×**. Across the seven short reads, the summed-time
advantage is **2.95×**.

Indexing policy matters here. Neo4j has ID uniqueness constraints and its
automatic token lookup indexes, with no workload-specific secondary indexes.
Datalevin automatically indexes attribute values. IC6 illustrates the
difference: its selected parameter produces an empty result, and Datalevin can
use an indexed tag-name lookup. Its 161.67× ratio describes that particular
case; it should not be generalized to every graph traversal.

This is an **LDBC-derived read-latency study**, not an official audited LDBC
throughput result. It retains one observation for one bundled parameter per
query, and the first query can include lazy compiler initialization in the
fresh JVM. All result counts agree; 17 queries also have identical canonical
result digests across engines. Four have documented output-representation
differences. Those details define what this strong result establishes.

## Documents: indexed paths and fast application operations

Datalevin's indexed document type stores nested documents and indexes their
paths. An application can query fields, numeric ranges, wildcard paths, and
array contents while keeping documents intact.

The [document benchmark](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks/idoc-bench)
compares this feature with PostgreSQL JSONB, SQLite JSON1, and MongoDB. It uses
10,000 documents and 10,000 measured operations per pass. The base mixes are
reads and updates for A, reads for C, and read-modify-write for F. Each adds
document queries with weight 30, producing roughly **23% document queries**
in the actual schedules.

All systems use explicit durable acknowledgment settings: Datalevin strict
WAL, PostgreSQL `synchronous_commit=on`, SQLite WAL `synchronous=FULL`, and
MongoDB `{w: 1, j: true}`. PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB receive indexes for
the query mix where supported. Measurements include client-observed execution,
transfer, and complete result-ID realization; Datalevin and SQLite are
embedded, while PostgreSQL and MongoDB use local servers.

![Document workload throughput with one and four workers. Datalevin leads A, C, and F with one worker, and C with four workers. PostgreSQL leads four-worker A and F.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/documents.svg)

With one worker, Datalevin leads all three mixes. Its **11,454 operations/s**
on C is **3.99×** MongoDB's 2,868, the best alternative. On A and F, its
advantage over runner-up PostgreSQL is approximately **1.48×** and **1.50×**.

The [four-worker results](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/idoc-bench/results/2026-09-01-strict-two-pass-summary.edn)
show a more varied picture. Datalevin reaches **32,192 operations/s** on C,
**2.43×** PostgreSQL's throughput. PostgreSQL leads A by about **10.5%** and F
by about **5.3%**. Datalevin's strongest advantage here is document querying;
concurrent mutation remains an area for further improvement.

The latency breakdown shows where the query advantage comes from.

![Single-worker workload C p50 latency for five document query shapes. Datalevin ranges from 0.051 to 0.328 milliseconds and has the lowest p50 on every shape. SQLite's nested-array shapes take over 22 milliseconds.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/document-latency.svg)

Datalevin has the lowest p50 for all five query shapes. Nested equality takes
**0.057 ms**; an any-depth wildcard takes **0.147 ms**; array matching takes
**0.207 ms**. SQLite is competitive on indexed scalar paths, but the two
nested-array shapes require scanning documents in this implementation.

Automatic path indexing makes a concrete difference for applications that
store evolving, nested records and later need to ask precise questions about
their contents.

## Logical workloads: recursion and derived relations

Recursive rules are central to Datalog. They express reachability, dependency
analysis, and relationships derived from other relationships in a compact
form. Their execution can also generate enormous intermediate results.

The [portable OpenRuleBench-derived suite](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/tree/1.1.0/benchmarks/openrulebench)
tests transitive closure (TC), same generation (SG), and trees of joins
(Join1). It compares Datalevin with SQLite, PostgreSQL, XSB, Soufflé, Clara
Rules, and O'Doyle Rules under a query-and-full-result-materialization timing
boundary. Data loading and program compilation are outside that interval.

![Ten logical tasks across seven engines. Datalevin has the lowest measured latency in every row. The matrix retains unsupported cells, Clara's out-of-memory failure, and O'Doyle's timeouts.](/images/datalevin-1.1.0/logic.svg)

The chart uses the [September 1 Datalevin 1.1.0 rerun](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/openrulebench/results/2026-09-01-datalevin-rerun.edn)
and the [August 26 alternative-engine measurements](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/benchmarks/openrulebench/results/2026-08-26-representative.edn).
Input digests and completed answer counts match across those artifacts.

Datalevin has the lowest measured latency in **all ten selected tasks**. For
cyclic transitive closure over 50,000 input facts, it materializes one million
result rows in **102.59 ms**. The fastest alternative, Soufflé, takes
**1,030.36 ms**, a **10.04×** ratio. For Join1 `b1` with both arguments free,
Datalevin takes **99.14 ms**, versus XSB's **1,795 ms**, an **18.11×** ratio.

Other leads are much smaller. Join1 `b2` is **162.41 ms** in Datalevin and
**174.00 ms** in XSB. The observed 1.07× ratio is useful to report alongside
the large wins, especially with only one retained measurement per task.

The suite uses deterministic generated relations following the paper's task
definitions; it does not recreate the lost historical input files. These ten
tasks are a representative subset, excluding the designated Join1 `a`
free/free stress case and the full scale/binding matrix. Clara's out-of-memory
cell and O'Doyle's 60-second timeouts occurred during warmup. Unsupported cells
remain marked N/A. Each Clojure wrapper uses an 8 GiB maximum heap; external
engines have their own resource configuration.

This is particularly encouraging for a persistent database: expressive rules
can deliver performance competitive with specialized logic systems.

## What changed in 1.1.0

The [release changelog](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/blob/1.1.0/CHANGELOG.md)
describes improvements throughout the engine: better join-cost estimates,
selective indexed lookups, parallel scans, execution in smaller work units,
specialized transitive-closure evaluation, and faster batched writes and local
identity upserts. Together, these changes target wasted intermediate work,
allocation, and transaction overhead.

The release also makes strict durability the default when enabling WAL without
an explicit profile. Python and JavaScript gain idiomatic, composable query
and transaction APIs. Performance and usability move forward together.

These cross-system results measure the builds recorded in the artifacts. They
are not a controlled 1.0-versus-1.1 experiment, so they do not assign a numerical
speedup to an individual optimization.

The larger lesson is architectural. Relational joins, graph edges, document
paths, and logical rules all benefit when the database can find relevant facts
quickly and avoid producing unnecessary intermediate results. Datalevin's
fact-based model gives those capabilities a common foundation.

## Read the numbers, then try your workload

The measurements were collected on a 12-core Apple Silicon macOS host with
Java 21.0.11; the JOB and logic studies identify the machine as an M3 Pro
MacBook Pro with 36 GB of memory. They are project-run benchmarks with specific
datasets, configurations, and timing boundaries.

The write study includes database growth in one measurement pass with no
discarded warmup. JOB, graph, and document studies retain a measurement pass
after a separate-process warmup; document runs also warm the newly built
database within each pass. Logic uses a complete warmup and measurement in the
same child JVM. These protocols produce observations, not confidence intervals,
and their different metrics should not be combined into one overall score.

For reproducibility, the charts have a downloadable
[data snapshot with source-file hashes](/extra/datalevin-1.1.0/benchmark-data.json).
The repository links above contain the harnesses and retained artifacts.
The graph and logic charts use newer 1.1.0 artifacts than the older tables
still present in their benchmark READMEs.

Datalevin 1.1.0 makes a strong case that one database can combine broad
expressiveness with leading performance across demanding workloads. That
opens up a useful design choice: keep application facts together, and use
relations, graphs, documents, and logic wherever each is most natural.

Get [Datalevin 1.1.0](https://github.com/datalevin/datalevin/releases/tag/1.1.0),
explore the [guide](https://datalevin.org/docs), and run the benchmark closest to
your application. I would love to see what you build with it.
