I recently stayed in Manhattan for a few days during a business trip. My colleague and I were looking for places to buy some special chocolate to bring back home. We asked a few locals New Yorker as well as consulted the web for recommendations. Here are the list of stores we collected.

-   La Maison Du Chocola ([store website](https://www.lamaisonduchocolat.com/en/boutiques.php?c=newyork))
-   Vosges ([store website](https://www.vosgeschocolate.com/boutiques))
-   Jacques Torres ([store website](https://www.mrchocolate.com))

We only have 3 hours to spend in the city. So we went to La Maison Du Chocola store in the Rockefelle Center, the store closest to our hotel.

Since there is not free sampling, I was not very sure that I would like to spend $100 on one pound of chocolate. I bought two small boxes with 6 pieces of chocolate each. Obviously, I am not the only one who is not sure: they even have tiny small packages with only two pieces of chocolate (for $8), accompanied with a pretty gift bag.

When I gave the gift to Huahai. He absolutely loves the chocolate. So it is money well spent and I plan to buy more for him when I go to NYC next time.
