If you have multiple machines but only one set of mouse and keyboard, then you must check out this neat little tool called [Synergy](https://synergy-foss.org). It allows you to seamlessly share mouse and keyboard across machines. It even allows you to copy and paste text across machines.

I have been using it for a few years now and have recommended it to many already. We all absolutely love it. My current set up is a desktop with two monitors and a set of keyboard and mouse connecting to it. Then I have a laptop with another monitor sharing the keyboard and mouse via Synergy with my desktop. This way I can use two machines and three monitors at the same time without any interruption.

Â I simply cannot imagine my life w/o Synergy. It is technically straightforward but really useful!
