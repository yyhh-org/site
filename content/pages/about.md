<!--![Photo of Yunyao and Huahai together](/images/slide-image-3.jpg)-->

We are a dual career married couple working in the information technology industry. We live in the California Bay Area. This site is about our lives, our thoughts, and everything going on about us. Hope you enjoy the time spent with us here. As you know, all human connections are real, even the "virtual" ones :-)

A lot of materials here are just our notes for solving some problems. Since it often takes a lot of time to find relevant information and adapt them to solve our problems, we keep a record here for later use. These notes might also be useful for people having similar problems. Wherever possible, we always link back to the original source of the solutions.
