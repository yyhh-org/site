As a busy computer scientist, I don't really get to exercise my inner Martha too much. But I did somehow manage to make my first ever attempt on sewing projects --- baby cloth shoes (as gift for my niece).

Here is the result --- I added the handmade pompom for extra cuteness. :)

The detailed steps can be found from the following link

I found the instructions there very easy to follow even for first-timers like myself. However, this is a fairly time consuming project (at least for me). I may do it again, but probably only when I am really bored. :-P
