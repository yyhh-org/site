The old master bathroom is dark and ugly, with only one sink and w/o tub.

We wanted a master bathroom that is modern and bright, and at the same time with a sense of Zen. We also wanted it to have two sink and separate shower and tub. Three months and a lot of work later, we have what we wanted and it totally worthies it since we are now enjoying it everyday.

I love everything about the new bathroom. But the top three on my lists are:

1\. Shower panel with rain head --- it makes each shower much enjoyable that I really miss it every time I go travel even when I stay in 5-star hotels.

2\. The recessed medical cabinets from Pottery Barn --- they are a little pricey but well-worth it, because they look nice and at the same time can hide all my stuff. They are the reason why the counter is always clutter-free.

3\. Maax Free Standing Air Tub --- It makes every bath a really relaxing experience and super easy to clean and maintain (no harder than a usual soaking tub, no worry for mold).
