As a cat, Mayori has impeccable taste, as represented by her favorite furniture in the house --- a Bertoia Diamond Lounge chair.

It is certainly a modern classic and a piece of highly functional cat furniture as well â€“ Mayori can attack Tom easily from all different angels and only need to defend her from one angel. What a smart cat!
