One major goal that I have for 2020 is tosimply my lifeso that I can spend time on more things that are more important, such as my own work as well as spending more quality time with family & friends.

One aspect of my life that I am seek to simplify is cooking dinner for my family. Even though Huahai is a better chef than me, I am the one responsible for cooking dinners for my family during most of the days for practical reasons.

For the next few months, I will be trying out different meal kits and record my impressions here on different dimensions. In the end, I will summary and share the final plan I settle on. Hopefully this will help other busy families simplify their lives as well.

1.[Gobble](https://www.gobble.com/)

This is the first meal kit service I tried. The most attractive aspect of this service is its promise of dinner kits designed for 15 minutes with 1 pan. This is also why I picked it as the first one to try.

|  Quality of Food   |  High   |
| --- | --- |
|  Easiness to Cook   |  Easy   |
|   Time Required   |  Low (<15 minutes)   |
|   Taste  |   Great  |
|   Packaging  | Good (each meal packaged together)    |
|   Price  |  High ($11.99 per serving + $6.99 delivery fee) 
|          |Total = $78.93 for 3 2-person dinners   |

I am pleasantly surprised that I could manage to get dinner cooked in 15 minutes as promised for all 6 meals I tried. The meal-kit is designed in a way that little preparation is required (e.g. vegetables come chopped). The choices of recipes are good and the meals are quite tasty. The main downside is that it is quite expensive compared to others. However, it seems to be keeper for busy families who do not want to compromise on the quality of their dinners.

2. Blue Apron



This is perhaps the most well-know meal kit service. Iâ€™ve heard about it many times from my colleagues. Naturally it is on the top of my list to try.

The recipes are pretty easy to follow. They are not as exotic as the ones from Gobble, but surprisingly tasty. My son especially loves the Seared Salmon & Shallot-Dijon Vinaigrette and asked to have it again just a couple of days later. The only minor thing is that not all ingredients for the same meals are packaged together, so it requires a bit sorting, but not really a deal-breaker.



3. Home Chef



This is another popular meal delivery service.

Home Chef offers many more choices including the options to buy additional protein pack as well as to add more meals for each week. The recipes are quite easy and tasty as well. The first box also includes a free recipe binder and the recipe cards already have punched holes, so it is super easy to save any recipe for future usage. The customer service is very responsive. I had a question related to my order and got a responsible by email in less than 2 hours on Saturday!



4. Sun Basket



Another popular option.

Overall, I like the recipe selection and the eco-friendly packaging. The food seems to be quite fresh and all organic. I also like the fact that it has more choices of recipes that does not contain as much grain as others. One thing of concern is that it does take more time to cook meals from Sun Basket on average.
