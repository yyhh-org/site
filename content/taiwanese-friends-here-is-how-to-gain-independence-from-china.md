## Is it possible for Taiwan to gain independence from China? 

The answer is, yes. 

Here's how.

Before we begin, let's put aside the silly notion that "Taiwan is already independent". Statehood, like marriage, is something more about the formality than substance. You are either an independent country, or you are not. 

Yes, you have an army, your own currency, your own passport, your elections, your government, so on and so forth. But, so do most of the large scale armed insurgences. 

If your statehood is not recognized by the international community, you are not independent. Particularly when your statehood is contested by a big country from which you try to depart, that country's consent is pretty much a requirement. Remember, British agreed to USA's independence in the end. You, too, will have to obtain China's consent.

How is that even possible, you may ask? Well, I am about to tell you. Read on.

First, let's look at the big picture. 

Do you know how many neighboring countries China has today? 

The short answer is "a lot". The long answer is the following: on land, there are 14 countries:  Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Vietnam; on the sea, there are 6 countries: Brunei, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Philippines. 

In total, twenty countries are in peaceful coexistence with China side by side! As you can also see, many of them are tiny countries that you may not even know about. Clearly, that "China bad" narrative you are made to believe does not hold much water. 

With so many neighboring countries, is it really a big deal from Chinese point of view that Taiwan is added to that list?

Objectively, not really.

Seriously? You ask. Yes, seriously. 

Let me put it this way: in that list of China's neighbors, there is a country that used to be a Chinese territory for more than **one thousand years**! It is unbelievable, right? But it is true.

If you do not know, that country is Vietnam. 

China has no problem with Vietnam being a separate country, which shares a land border with China, you think China will have problem with Taiwan being as a separate country, which is located hundreds of miles away in the sea? 

So why is Taiwan special? What is the deal with Chinese demanding everyone else to recognize Taiwan as a part of China? What's the difference?

The answer will be counter-intuitive, but it makes sense if you think about it. Basically, it is less about how China thinks, but more to do with how Taiwan acts.

The gist of it, is that Taiwan does not act like a neighboring country of China, instead, Taiwan acts like a renegade Chinese insurgency, that's why China has to deal with her as such. 

## Taiwan acts like a Chinese insurgence

Let's omit the history for a moment, just focus on the current affairs. Let us explore Taiwan's behaviors, shall we?

### Taiwan government funds anti-Chinese government propaganda

First, it is well documented that Taiwan government is one of the primary funding sources of anti-Chinese government propaganda around the world. 

Let's just look at US, for example. Here is a quote from [an US news article](https://prospect.org/world/taiwan-funding-think-tanks-omnipresent-rarely-disclosed/)

> The five think tanks—the Brookings Institution, the Center for American Progress, the Center for a New American Security, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Hudson Institute—all disclose their funding from TECRO but bury it deep on their websites or annual reports.
