Nowadays we do a lot of text input on the Web, like posting on forums, filling out a support request form, commenting on someone's blog, etc. Although Web forms often offer a variety of so-called rich text editing capabilities, nothing beats the good old desktop editors. For a vim person, a plain Web textarea simply is not the place for text editing. Fortunately, for Firefox users, this pain can be eased. There are a few Firefox addons that allow people to use external editors for editing textarea. This [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_editor_support) lists quite a few options. I tried [It's All Text!](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4125), and it works very well. It supports utf-8 encoding so I can write Chinese. Now I can seriously consider using gmail as my primary email client.
